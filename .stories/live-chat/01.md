We need:
  - Angular 2+
  - NestJs
  - npm
  - docker

#### Story:
As a developer I wanna use Angular and NestJs to be setup, both should be running on docker using dockerfile.
They should be run/started using docker-compose so that we can start everything with just one command.
The NestJs backend should connect to the Postgress Database server, that is also started with docker-compose file.
At The end, docker the FrontEnd should be should be able to retrieve the value from backend, all happens inside the docker.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Setup Angular 2+
- Setup NestJS
- Start Angular using docker-componse/Dockerfile & access in the browser via http://localhost:4200
- Start NestJs using docker-componse/Dockerfile & access in the browser via http://localhost:3333/api
- NestJs should connect to the Postgress DB server using docker-compose
- Angular should display a value that has been retrieved from the backend service
